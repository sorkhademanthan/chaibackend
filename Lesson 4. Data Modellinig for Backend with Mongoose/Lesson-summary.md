2. What Is Mongoose & Why Use It?
Mongoose is a JavaScript ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for Node.js and MongoDB. It provides schema-based structure, validation, query abstraction, virtuals, middleware, and more

3. Defining a Schema
Set up fields and define types, validators (e.g., required, unique, lowercase), default values, and timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)

.

4. Creating Models
Use mongoose.model('Name', schema) to create a Model class, which automatically maps to a lowercased, pluralized MongoDB collection name

5. Field Options / Validation Rules
Demonstrates how to enforce constraints such as type, required messages, uniqueness, and custom validation logic within schema definitions

6. Relationships: Embedding vs Referencing
Explains strategies to handle document relationships:

Embedded subdocuments for 1‚ÄëFew or static embedded data

References (ref) for 1‚ÄëMany or Many‚ÄëMany relationships

Guidance on when to normalize (use references) or denormalize (use embedding)

7. Schema Methods, Virtuals & Middleware
Use schema instance/static methods and virtual fields for business logic.

Employ pre/post middleware (hooks) to run code before or after document lifecycle events, enabling validation, hashing, logging, etc. (Common Mongoose patterns)

8. Population Patterns
Showcases how to load referenced documents via populate(), including nested populates and selective fields, to resolve relationships at query time (especially for Todo apps with sub‚Äëtodos)

9. Indexing & Performance
Emphasizes adding indexes for fields used in frequent queries or lookups.

Discuss proper schema planning to avoid data duplication and support query performance

10. Organizing Your Models in a Project
Recommends separation of schemas into modules/files (e.g., user.model.js, todo.model.js, etc.), and keeping clean folder structure for maintainability

11. Putting It All Together ‚Äì A Sample Todo App
Likely walks through a simple ‚ÄúTodo + Sub‚ÄëTodo‚Äù app‚Äîdefining User, Todo, and SubTodo schemas and models, configuring relationships, applying validation, using timestamps, and then querying with population

‚úÖ Why This Content Matters
Structured Data Architecture: A proper schema enforces clean data modeling and maintainable code.

Data Integrity & Validation: Using declarative rules ensures consistency and helps catch bugs early.

Efficient Querying: Effective use of populate, virtuals, and indexing optimizes data access.

Scalability: Embedding vs referencing strategies support growth and evolving use cases.
